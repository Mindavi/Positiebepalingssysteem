# Positiebepalingssysteem
The goal is to detect the position of people in a room, with cameras. This is done with the help of the OpenCV framework, found here: <https://www.github.com/opencv/opencv>

## How to use
To build this project, you need to have OpenCV libraries installed on your computer. You'll probably have to build that library yourself.

## Test library

http://www.viratdata.org/ might be useful to use for checking if the algorithm works correctly.
