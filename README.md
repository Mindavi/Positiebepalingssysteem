# Positiebepalingssysteem
The goal is to detect the position of people in a room, with cameras. The application will output this data as coordinates. The idea is to make this project totally modular. This is done, so you can use the small modules to build something completely different, without having to rewrite the whole thing. The idea is to make an application out of every module.

This is done with the help of the OpenCV framework, found here: <https://www.github.com/opencv/opencv>

## How to use
To build this project, you need to have OpenCV libraries installed on your computer. You'll probably have to build that library yourself.
